# Comprehensive Refactoring Plan for AI Canvas

## Backend Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Architecture Restructuring
- [ ] Reorganize file structure to follow clean architecture patterns
- [ ] Create separate API, domain, and infrastructure layers
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection across components
- [ ] Add configuration management module to centralize environment settings

### 2. Service Layer Improvements
- [ ] Split `graph_service.py` into `GraphService`, `NodeService`, and `EdgeService`
- [ ] Create dedicated `WorkflowService` for execution logic
- [ ] Implement `TopologyService` for graph analysis algorithms
- [ ] Extract `ConversationService` from existing chat handlers
- [ ] Create `AIProviderFactory` to abstract provider selection

### 3. Data Access Layer
- [ ] Implement repository classes for all entity types (Graph, Node, Edge, etc.)
- [ ] Move all database operations from services to repositories
- [ ] Create database migration system using Alembic
- [ ] Add data validation layer before persistence operations

### 4. API Enhancements
- [ ] Standardize API response format across all endpoints
- [ ] Implement request validation using Pydantic or similar library
- [ ] Add pagination support for list endpoints
- [ ] Create proper API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Refactor route handlers to controller classes

### 5. Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Create custom exception hierarchy for domain-specific errors
- [ ] Implement global error handler for consistent responses
- [ ] Add structured logging throughout the application
- [ ] Create middleware for request/response logging
- [ ] Implement proper transaction management

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Add unit tests for all services and repositories
- [ ] Create integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement test fixtures and factory patterns
- [ ] Add CI/CD configuration for automated testing

## Frontend Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Component Structure
- [ ] Split `GraphManager.js` into smaller focused components
- [ ] Extract `NodeManager` and `EdgeManager` from GraphManager
- [ ] Divide `ConversationManager.js` into `ChatService` and `ChatView`
- [ ] Break down `UIManager.js` into specialized UI handlers
- [ ] Separate `WorkflowManager.js` execution logic from UI logic

### 2. Service Abstraction
- [ ] Create dedicated service objects for each API resource
- [ ] Implement proper service factories where needed
- [ ] Extract common utilities into shared modules
- [ ] Create validation services for input handling

### 3. State Management
- [ ] Implement proper state management system
- [ ] Reduce direct component dependencies
- [ ] Create observable stores for shared state
- [ ] Implement proper state serialization for persistence

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Separate UI rendering logic from data management
- [ ] Create reusable UI components
- [ ] Implement better loading and error states
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements
- [ ] Create consistent component styling system

### 5. API Client Improvements
- [ ] Reorganize `APIClient.js` into resource-specific modules
- [ ] Implement better retry and error handling logic
- [ ] Add response caching where appropriate
- [ ] Create mock API for testing and development
- [ ] Add request/response interceptors for logging

### 6. Event System Enhancements
- [ ] Strengthen event-driven architecture
- [ ] Add event history and replay capabilities
- [ ] Implement typed events for better type safety
- [ ] Create event middleware for logging/debugging
- [ ] Add event visualization for debugging

### 7. Testing Framework
- [ ] Add unit tests for core business logic
- [ ] Implement component tests for UI elements
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for critical workflows
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing for UI components

## Shared Improvements

### 1. Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Document architecture patterns and decisions
- [ ] Create user documentation for features
- [ ] Document deployment and configuration options

### 2. Development Environment
- [ ] Implement consistent code formatting
- [ ] Add linting configuration
- [ ] Create development containers
- [ ] Standardize build and deployment processes
- [ ] Set up proper development/staging/production environments

### 3. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement proper authentication/authorization
- [ ] Add input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Create rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Secure sensitive configurations
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration

This comprehensive refactoring plan addresses the major issues in both frontend and backend while maintaining all current functionality. Implementation should be prioritized based on critical areas and can be phased in gradually to avoid disrupting the current system.
